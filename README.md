**Tradeoffs & Notes**

**In-memory DB**
Bookings are currently stored in memory (reset on restart). This was chosen for simplicity during MVP development.
Next step: use PostgreSQL + Prisma for persistence.

**Auth**
JWT authentication implemented. For testing purposes, AsyncStorage and JWT are mocked in frontend tests.

**CI/CD**
Not yet implemented, but repo is structured to easily add GitHub Actions or similar.

**UI/UX**
Focused on core functionality first. Future improvements can polish the UX/UI experience.
